  <h1>Client / Developer Team Project – Report</h1>

  <h2>Client Report</h2>
  <p>As a customer, I decided on the content and images of my site with the audience in mind. Communication with my developer was clear and constant (during the subject classes). There were some adjustments in response times, but we managed to maintain an orderly workflow. The result met my expectations: A functional, attractive site with useful information for customers. If I were to rehire a team, I think I would give more frequent feedback and set more detailed timelines for each phase.</p>

  <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
  <p>We created the requested CSS file and attempted to create the 2 missing pages for the Addy project. Unfortunately, due to time and the size of the team, it was not possible to finish the project perfectly, so only the shell could be delivered. We have to recognize that a lot of communication with the client was necessary. Between the lack of communication, lack of staff, and the semester closing, we could not do an impeccable job but one functional and simple to understand.</p>

  <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
  <p>As a Junior Developer I consider that I only miscommunicated with one of my Leads. I was able to work and make the requested changes in the Mustang page, so I consider that a resounding success and I really learned a lot about the importance of team communication. Even though the communication was not perfect or fluid, the papers were delivered as well as possible and that is already a plus point in my opinion.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
  <p>I would like to summarize this part as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stress Levels</li>
    <li>Teamwork: 6/10</li>
    <li>Communication: 5/10</li>
    <li>Product Development (Codes): 9/10</li>
    <li>Final Product: 9/10</li>
    <li>Consulting (By the teacher and TA): 10/10</li>
    <li>Overall Experience: 7.8/10</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is because although we are prepared to develop projects using HTML, team communication is essential. I do not blame my colleagues, I just stress the importance of the points on which we failed.</p>
